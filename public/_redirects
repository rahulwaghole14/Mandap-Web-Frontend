# SPA routing support for Render
# This file must be in the dist folder after build
# Render will automatically use this for routing

# Serve static assets directly (optional - Render handles this automatically)
/assets/* 200

# API routes - don't redirect (if proxied through Render)
/api/* 200

# SPA fallback - all other routes go to index.html
/*    /index.html   200
