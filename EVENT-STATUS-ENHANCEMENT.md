# Event Status Enhancement

## ✅ Feature: Hide "Upcoming" Tag for Past Events

### **🎯 What Was Implemented:**

**Problem:** Events with "Upcoming" status were still showing the "Upcoming" tag even after their date had passed.

**Solution:** Added logic to automatically hide the "Upcoming" status tag for events whose date has already passed.

### **🔧 Technical Implementation:**

#### **1. Date Comparison Function:**
```javascript
const isEventDatePassed = (eventDate) => {
  if (!eventDate) return false;
  
  const eventDateObj = new Date(eventDate);
  const today = new Date();
  
  // Set time to start of day for accurate comparison
  today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  eventDateObj.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  
  return eventDateObj < today;
};
```

#### **2. Display Status Logic:**
```javascript
const getDisplayStatus = (event) => {
  if (event.status === 'Upcoming' && isEventDatePassed(event.startDate)) {
    return null; // Don't show status if event date has passed
  }
  return event.status;
};
```

#### **3. Updated Event Card Display:**
```javascript
// Before: Always showed status
<span className={`... ${getStatusColor(event.status)}`}>
  {event.status}
</span>

// After: Conditionally shows status
{getDisplayStatus(event) && (
  <span className={`... ${getStatusColor(getDisplayStatus(event))}`}>
    {getDisplayStatus(event)}
  </span>
)}
```

### **📍 Changes Made:**

1. **✅ Event Cards** - Status tag hidden for past "Upcoming" events
2. **✅ Event Detail Modal** - Status tag hidden for past "Upcoming" events
3. **✅ Date Logic** - Accurate date comparison (ignores time, compares dates only)
4. **✅ Code Cleanup** - Removed console.log from EventGallery component

### **🎨 User Experience:**

#### **Before:**
- Events with "Upcoming" status always showed the blue "Upcoming" tag
- Even events from last month would still show "Upcoming"
- Confusing for users to see past events marked as "Upcoming"

#### **After:**
- Events with "Upcoming" status only show the tag if the date hasn't passed
- Past events with "Upcoming" status show no status tag
- Clear visual indication of event timing
- Better user experience and less confusion

### **📊 Status Display Logic:**

| Event Status | Date Status | Display Result |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| "Upcoming" | Future Date | ✅ Shows "Upcoming" tag |
| "Upcoming" | Past Date | ❌ No status tag shown |
| "Active" | Any Date | ✅ Shows "Active" tag |
| "Completed" | Any Date | ✅ Shows "Completed" tag |
| "Cancelled" | Any Date | ✅ Shows "Cancelled" tag |
| "Postponed" | Any Date | ✅ Shows "Postponed" tag |

### **🧪 Testing Scenarios:**

1. **✅ Future Event with "Upcoming" Status**
   - Should display blue "Upcoming" tag
   
2. **✅ Past Event with "Upcoming" Status**
   - Should NOT display any status tag
   
3. **✅ Event with Other Status (Active, Completed, etc.)**
   - Should display appropriate status tag regardless of date

### **🔍 Date Comparison Details:**

- **Time Ignored:** Only compares dates, not times
- **Timezone Safe:** Uses local browser timezone
- **Accurate:** Sets both dates to start of day (00:00:00) for fair comparison
- **Null Safe:** Handles missing dates gracefully

### **📱 Affected Components:**

1. **Event Cards** - Main event listing grid
2. **Event Detail Modal** - Individual event view
3. **Status Display** - Both card and modal views

## ✅ **Enhancement Complete**

**Events with "Upcoming" status will no longer show the status tag if their date has passed, providing a cleaner and more accurate user experience.**
